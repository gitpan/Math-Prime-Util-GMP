Revision history for Perl extension Math::Prime::Util::GMP

0.06  17 December 2012

    - Fix 1-byte memory overrun (thanks to CPAN Testers, Solaris, Valgrind).

    - Add factoring of small numbers.  Helps a little when the input gets
      reduced enough to fit into a UV.

0.05  15 December 2012

    - Add AKS primality test.  Super slow, but nice to have around.

    - ECM is faster.

    - Add a small prime iterator, which means _much_ less memory and faster
      operation for big smoothness factors in pminus1 and ecm factoring.

    - Add simple prime_count function.  It uses next_prime so is terribly slow
      for big ranges.  However it's a lot faster than the PP code when given
      a large base and small range e.g. (10**96, 10**96 + 2**18).

    - Add primorial, pn_primorial, and consecutive_integer_lcm functions.

    - Factoring:
         Add a perfect power test.
         Add a simple ECM factoring method.
         Speed up SQUFOF a bit.
         Complete p-1 rewrite.  Much faster and finds more factors.
         Adjust general factor() mix.

    - Add Pocklington-Lehmer and BLS primality tests.  is_prime() uses the
      BLS test with a quick factoring attempt for numbers less than 2^200,
      though the chances of success drop off as the size increases.
      The point is not to cull mismarked probable primes (we use BPSW so this
      is highly unlikely for these small sizes), but to quickly mark more
      numbers as definitely prime.  Remember to use is_prob_prime if you do
      not care about this distinction and want the result slightly faster.

    - add is_provable_prime function that calls BLS with much more aggressive
      factoring.

    - XS callable: _lcm_of_consecutive_integers(B)
      which is a better alternative for B! for many factoring algorithms.
    - Fix some minor compile issues.

0.02  15 July 2012
    - Factoring tests assumed 64-bit.  Rewrite.

0.01  15 July 2012
    - Initial release
